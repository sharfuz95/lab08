                I have always been highly interested in Entrepreneurship. 
                When I recognized that there wasnâ€™t a proper entrepreneurial ecosystem at UR, I decided to make one.
                 With my friend I co-founded Meliora LaunchPad, which is the undergraduate entrepreneurship student organization at University of Rochester. 
                 I am currently the President of the organization. My two other notable involvement includes being the co-founder of Residence Hall Association (RHA) and also being the current president of Order of Omega.
